# üì∏ Daily Snapshot (SnapBot)

**Turn your daily Discord chatter into a stylish, share-worthy recap card ‚Äî delivered every night via DM!**

---

## Elevator Pitch

Daily Snapshot is a tiny personal-analytics Discord bot that quietly watches how you chat each day, cooks the data into a stylish HTML ‚Äústory card,‚Äù and DMs you a screenshot at night so you can reflect, laugh, and level-up your vibes. No third-party APIs or token headaches ‚Äî just pure Discord magic.

- **Top 5 Words & Emojis:** Frequency tally excluding common stop words.
- **Mood Check-In:** Use `!mood` command to log your mood with emoji reactions.
- **Mini Notepad:** DM `!note Your thought` to save a daily note.
- **Automatic 9 PM Recap:** At 21:00 server local time, generates an HTML snapshot, converts it to an image, and sends it via DM.
- **Theme Selector:** Use `!theme pastel | dark | neon` to customize your card style.
